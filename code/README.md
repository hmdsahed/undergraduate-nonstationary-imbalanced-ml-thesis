# Code Overview

This folder contains Python scripts used in the undergraduate thesis
"A Diagnostic-Driven Framework for Selecting Hybrid ML Strategies in Nonstationary and Imbalanced Data".

## Structure

- `diagnostics/`  
  Scripts for statistical and model-based diagnostics such as stationarity tests,
  class imbalance measures, and concept drift indicators.

- `models/`  
  Model training, evaluation, and update strategies.

- `utils/`  
  Helper functions used across the project.

## Note

Jupyter notebooks used during experimentation are converted into clean Python
scripts before being added here.
